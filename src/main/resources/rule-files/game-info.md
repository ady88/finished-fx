The game components are:
 - 48 playing cards numbered 1 to 48
 - 10 candy tokens
 - 7 coffee tokens

Game Preparation:
1. Game starts with 7 cofee tokens and 5 candy tokens in the active stash area. Remaining 5 candy are in the reserved stash.
2. Cards from 1 to 47 will be shuffled to have a random order. Card 48 is placed below all these cards. This pile of 48 cards will now be known as the draw stack. These cards will never be shuffeled again. Insstead the player will cycle through the draw stack over several rounds, as turn by turn he sorts the cards in the present area.

Game areas:
1. Active stash - place where the number of coffee tokens and candy tokens the player may use. 
2. Reserved stash - place where the place for the number of coffee tokens and candy tokens the player may not use
3. Draw stack - pile from where the player will draw from at the start of each turn or if certain actions are done.
4. Present Area - the only area where cards may be sorted and actions may be used - using candy tokens- on the cards
5. Past Area - when the player decides no further actions are to be done on the present area cards then these are moved to the past area. All card abilities are reseted on the cards when moving them to the past area.
6. Future Areas - one or more. Certain actions allow to move cards to future areas - cardIntoFuture, allCardsIntoFuture.
7. Finished Pile - all cards that are scored are placed in this pile in ascending numerical order
